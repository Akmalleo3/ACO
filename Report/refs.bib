abstract = {The parallelization of metaheuristics and care for the efficient use of the available infrastructure is very popular in the case of population-based algorithms (e.g., evolutionary ones), as many of them have structures intrinsically easy for parallelization. However, swarm computing algorithms (ACO in particular) must use certain global knowledge in order to be properly implemented (e.g., a pheromone matrix in the case of ACO algorithms). Thus, the parallelization of ACO is known to be difficult to realize. In this paper, we propose an actor-based approach for constructing an efficient and robust ACO implementation that leverages the HPC infrastructure. The presented results show the ability to be scaled for up to 30 nodes, and the relevant results support the claim that the implemented algorithm is equal to the original Ant System algorithm. Improving it further and increasing its scalability with the planned asynchrony in the pheromone matrix updates is envisioned as a direct future work.}

abstract = {This paper presents a configurable distributed architecture for ant colony optimization. We represent the problem environment as a distributed multi-agent system, and we reduce ant management to messages that are asynchronously exchanged between agents. The experimental setup allows the deployment of the system on computer clusters, as well as on ordinary computer networks. We present experimental results that we obtained by utilizing our system to solve nontrivial instances of the traveling salesman problem. The results support the effectiveness and scalability of our proposal.}
